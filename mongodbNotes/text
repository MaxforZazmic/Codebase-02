In Mongo DB you got:
1. Database > collection(like users, products) > documents (piece of data about specific user, product)
2. every entry has it's unique id to identify a specific piece of data.

for example:
db.products.insertOne({_id:1, productName:"Pencil",  price: 1.2})

//  this way you insert entry with ID:1 to a products collection. you can either insert additional data to this entry using it's id, or create additional entries.

db.products.find ({name: "Pencil"})    // this will query the documents that contains name:"Pencil"


db.products.updateOne( {_id:1}, {$set: {stock: 23}})   // in document where Id:1 you record new properties.
