steps to create React Node application 

1. create Server folder 
 - in the server folder, run npm init 
 - run npm i express, npm i nodemon
 - this way you'll set up a server 
 - in index.js or whatever is a main root file, write an api and listen it to a specific port 

 this is how you build a back-end business logic
2. create Client folder 
- go in client folder and run "npx create-react-app appname" to creeate a react app 
- go to Client/appname directory and run " npm start"  to start react app 
- then use fetch method to build connection between react and server and reqeust data
